Units in HTML 
<!-- HTML supports a number of different units of measurement. The most commonly used units are pixels, ems, and percentages, but there are many others to choose from. -->

<!-- Pixels are the most basic unit of measurement in HTML. They are used to measure the size of an
element in terms of the number of pixels it occupies on the screen. For example, if you set the width of an element to 100 pixels, it will be 100 pixels wide on the screen. -->

<!-- Ems are another common unit of measurement in HTML. They are used to measure the size of an element in terms of the size of the font that is being used. For example, if you set the width of an element to 2 ems, it will be twice as wide as the font size that is being used. -->

<!-- Percentages are another common unit of measurement in HTML. They are used to measure the size of an element in terms of a percentage of the size of its parent element. For example, if you set the width of an element to 50%, it will be half as wide as its parent element. -->

<!-- There are many other units of measurement that can be used in HTML, including inches, centimeters, millimeters, points, and picas. Each of these units has its own unique properties and can be used in different situations depending on the needs of the developer. -->

<!-- Here is an example of how to use units in HTML: -->

        }
