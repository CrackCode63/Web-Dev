Inline ELements in HTML 

<!-- What is Inline Elements in HTML? -->

<!-- Inline elements in HTML are used to define elements that are displayed inline with the surrounding text. These elements do not start on a new line and only occupy the space bounded by the tags defining the element. Inline elements are used to style or format text, links, images, and other content within a block-level element.
Inline elements are those elements that only occupy the space bounded by the tags defining the element, not the entire line. -->
