<!-- What is HTML Entities? -->

<!-- HTML entities are special characters that are used to represent reserved characters, characters that are not easily typed on a keyboard, and characters that have special meaning in HTML. These entities are used to ensure that the characters are displayed correctly in the browser and do not interfere with the HTML code. -->

<!-- For example, the less-than sign (<) and the greater-than sign (>) are reserved characters in
HTML and cannot be used directly in the code. -->

<!-- Instead, you need to use the HTML entities and > to represent these characters.
There are many HTML entities available for different characters, symbols, and special characters. Here are some common HTML entities: -->
