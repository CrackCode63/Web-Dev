<!-- What is Flex-Box in CSS? -->
<!-- Flexbox is a layout mode in CSS that allows you to create flexible and responsive layouts. It was
introduced in CSS3 and has become a widely used and powerful tool for web developers. -->

<!-- The main features of Flexbox include: -->

<!-- * Flex containers: These are the elements that contain the flexible items. They can be either block-level elements or inline elements. -->

<!-- * Flex items: These are the elements that are contained within the flex container. They can be either block-level elements or inline elements. -->

<!-- * Flex direction: This determines the direction in which the flex items are laid out. It can be either row or column. -->

<!-- * Flex wrap: This determines whether the flex items should wrap to a new line when there is not
enough space to display them all on one line. -->

<!-- What is the main difference between Flexbox and Grid? -->
<!-- The main difference between Flexbox and Grid is that Flexbox is used for one-dimensional layouts, while Grid is used for two-dimensional layouts. Flexbox is used to lay out items in a single row or column, while Grid is used to create a grid of items that can be laid out in multiple rows and columns. -->
