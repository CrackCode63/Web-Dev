<!-- Attributes in HTML are used to add additional information to an HTML element. They are used to provide mor
e information about the element, such as its behavior, appearance, or relationships with other elements.
Attributes are added to an element by using the name of the attribute followed by an equals sign (=)
and the value of the attribute enclosed in double quotes (""). -->
Example:
<img src="image.jpg" alt="This is an image">


<!-- In this example, the src and alt attributes are added to the <img> element to specify the source of the image and its alternate text.
