<!-- Pseudo Class in HTML  -->

<!-- Pseudo-classes in CSS are used to define the special state of an element. For example, a pseudo-class can be used to style an element when a user mouses over it or when it gets focus. Pseudo-classes are used to add special effects to elements without using JavaScript. -->

a:visited - a link the user has visited
a:hover - a link when the user mouses over it
a:active - a link the moment it is clicked
a:checked - a radio button or checkbox once it has been checked
a:enabled - a form element that is enabled
